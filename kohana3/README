DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream
  This is a pure export of what's in Kohana's git repo.

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what we need in gallery3.


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh    # Pay attention to the Kohana revision number.
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

$ git commit -m "Updated modified to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3 -p3

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ php index.php test # run tests
$ git commit -m "Updated Kohana to r<REVISION_NUMBER>"

$ cd gallery3-vendor/kohana3 && git push
$ cd gallery3 && git push


VERIFYING PATCHES
-----------------

We have some patches in our version of the Kohana code.  Each patch is applied
to the modified tree.  Our modified tree should be exactly the same as what's in
the gallery3 codebase.

To find any differences you can run a diff command
$ diff --exclude=bootstrap.php -r modified ../../gallery3 | egrep -v '^Only in'

Currently active patches:
  #4739  Security preamble missing from several files
  #4740  Make security preamble consistent in a few places where it deviates slightly
