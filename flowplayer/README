DESCRIPTION
-----------
Our Flowplayer distribution includes the iPad and pseudostreaming plugins and has 5 files:
- 4 swf files, taken without modification from their releases
- 1 js file, which needs to be rebuilt from source with a patch

BUG AND PATCH
-------------
We need the patch because Flowplayer uses the flashembed library, which has a bug that disallows
special characters in the path.  This bug has persisted since 2010, when we originally patched it
and reported it to Flowplayer, who as of early 2013 still haven't fixed it.

All relevant info and links have been collected here:
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gallery/ticket/2017

To test if this bug still persists in future versions, create a movie in an album with special
characters (e.g. "umläüt"), and see if it plays.  If you get a 200 error, the patch is still needed.
Alternatively, you can search the flashembed.js source file to see if it still has the rather
appropriate comment "a dirty hack, I admit" (funny, but not actually a joke...)
