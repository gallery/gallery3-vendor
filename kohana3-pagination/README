Pagination -- 3.3/master branch last revised 2013/02/25
- project homepage https://github.com/shadowhand/pagination

History (taken from gallery-devel email thread 2013/03/30):

This library was originally in Kohana 2.x, but left after 2.3, so we
put it in kohana23_compat for 2.4.  Similarly, it was originally in
Kohana 3.x but left after 3.1.  Some folks forked the module and made
it compatible with 3.2 (http://github.com/kloopko/kohana-pagination),
and others forked that to make it work with 3.3
(https://github.com/webking/kohana-pagination).  But it looks like
shadowhand (main Kohana dev) is keeping a fork up to date so let's
track that one.

So in a sense, this is the 3.3-compatible version of Kohana's original
library.
