CURRENT INFO -- 2013/03/29
--------------------------
ZenPhoto Exifer -- 1.7 (2012/12)
- project homepage:  http://github.com/zenphoto/zenphoto/tree/master/zp-core/exif

There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure git export of what's in the exifer tree.  We check out the files one-by-one,
  so check the project homepage to make sure we still have a current list in refresh_upstream.sh.

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what need in gallery3/modules/exif/vendor/exifer


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
  # Check the upstream directory and resolve any added/deleted files
  # and then commit.  MAKE SURE that you mention the upstream rev that
  # we're synced to in your commit message!
$ git commit -m "Updated to Exifer r<REVISION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

$ git commit -m "Updated to Exifer r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3/modules/exif/lib -p3
$ git push

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ git commit -m "Updated to Exifer r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modules/exif/lib
$ git push


VERIFYING PATCHES
-----------------

We have some patches in our version of the Exifer code.  After every
update, you should verify that every one of our deviations is tracked
by a ticket on zenphoto.org.

To see the differences you can run a diff command:

$ diff -r modified ../../gallery3/modules/exif/lib

Expected differences:
1) Not tracked: Gallery3 doesn't use gettext for localization, but exifer does so we
   convert all "gettext(...)" calls to "(string) t(...)" calls as part of running
   refresh_modified.sh

2) We add the standard Kohana security line at the top of each php file.

3) We remove Windows line endings.
