CURRENT INFO -- 2013/03/03
--------------------------
This is a PHP class for using Google's Closure Compiler web service for minifying JS.  This only
implements a REST API.  The minification code itself is implemented online and therefore kept
current without us needing to track it.

We use this in ../gallery_tools, which is in turn used by a variety of scripts in gallery3-vendor.
