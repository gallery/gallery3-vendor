History (taken from gallery-devel email thread 2013/03/30):

This library was originally in Kohana 2.x, but left after 2.3, so we put it in kohana23_compat
for 2.4.  Similarly, it was originally in Kohana 3.x but left after 3.1.  Some folks forked the
module and made it compatible with 3.2 (http://github.com/kloopko/kohana-pagination),
and others forked that to make it work with 3.3 (https://github.com/webking/kohana-pagination).

So in a sense, this is the 3.3-compatible version of Kohana's original library.
