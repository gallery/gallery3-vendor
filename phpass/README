DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure copy of PHPass 0.3 from http://www.openwall.com/phpass/
  For Gallery 3.0.x, we used PHPass 0.1.  There are no major changes
  between the versions, so we can use them more-or-less interchangeably.

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what we need in gallery3/trunk/modules/user/lib


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to r<VERSION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.
$ git commit -m "Updated to PHPass r<VERSION_NUMBER>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3/modules/user/lib -p3
$ git push

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ git commit -m "Updated to PHPass r<VERSION_NUMBER>" modules/user/lib
$ git push
