CURRENT INFO -- 2013/03/09
--------------------------
This is the MediaElementJS 2.10.3 zip downloaded from:
  http://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/zipball/master

Run refresh_modified.sh to copy the files necessary to modified.  Add the --no-minify flag to copy
the unminified versions of JS and CSS.  Then, copy to ../gallery3/lib/mediaelementjs.

We basically want:
- the two main JS libraries (as separate files, not the combined version)
- the Flash and Silverlight files
- the CSS and images that go with the default skin
