CURRENT INFO -- 2013/08/28
--------------------------
This is the MediaElementJS 2.13.1 from:
  http://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement

We basically want:
- the two main JS libraries (as separate files, not the combined version)
- the Flash and Silverlight files
- the CSS and images that go with the default skin

TODO: as of v2.13, the upstream distribution ships with two swf files - one
intended for CDN, and one that (appears) more secure by default.  In other
words, we may no longer need the query-stripping php preamble.

UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to <git id>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.
$ git commit -m "Updated modified to <git id>" modified
$ rsync -ravz modified/ ../../gallery3/lib/mediaelementjs
$ git push
