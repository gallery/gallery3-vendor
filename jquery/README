For each of these libs, download from the links below into the upstream directory.  Then, run the
refresh_modified script (which renames appropriately and minifies as needed)

If you want them minified:
- download from the minified links (if applicable)
- run refresh_modified.sh

If you want them unminified:
- download from the unminified links (if applicable)

LEGACY PATCHES - JQUERY UI
--------------------------
For Gallery v3.0.x, we applied some patches to jQuery-UI.  Since then all patches have
either been fixed or no longer seem to affect Gallery, so we no longer apply them.  We keep the
now-outdated patches and notes here for reference.

http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4441: Mousedown on scrollbar start selectable
- was issue in 1.7.2, we patched it.
- doesn't appear to be fixed in 1.10.1.
- doesn't appear to affect us (grep for ".selectable(" in core and find nothing)
- if ever it should affect us, a workaround is suggested in the ticket to avoid the patch.

http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4377: Wrong offset when using appendTo on element other than body.
- was issue in 1.7.2, we patched it.
- doesn't appear to be fixed in 1.10.1
- doesn't appear to affect us (grep for "appendTo" in core and only find when applied to body)

http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/2843: Selectables and draggables
- was issue in 1.7.2, we patched it.
- fixed in core sometime before 1.8.

http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/5370: All drag & drop events fail in IE9
- was issue in 1.7.2, we patched it.
- fixed in core in 1.8.6.

LEGACY PATCHES - JQUERY AUTOCOMPLETE
------------------------------------
For Gallery v3.0.x, we used an autocomplete library that was separate from the jQuery-UI
library.  Also, we applied a couple patches.  We no longer have a separate library, and no longer
apply patches directly to them.  We keep the now-outdated patches and notes here for reference.

Currently, we add the same CSS changes to ../../gallery3/modules/gallery3/css/gallery.css.
