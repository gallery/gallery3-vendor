<       background: white url('indicator.gif') right center no-repeat;
---
>       background: white url('images/loading-small.gif') right center no-repeat;

We're adding alignment in the .ac_result class, and changing the indicator.

We've added a semi-colon to the end of the jquery-autocomplete.js
