CURRENT INFO -- 2013/03/07
--------------------------
This is the ExtJS 3.4.0 zip downloaded from:
  http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs3/download/

Run refresh_modified.sh to build the JS bundle in there and stage the CSS and images.

Note that *most*, but not all, of the JS components are delivered as already minified, so we don't
need to re-minify them (and possibly introduce Sencha/Google incompatibilities).  All we need to do
is strip out duplicate copyright headers.  Also note that the list of images copied is not
dynamically-generated (@todo - refine this).

PREVIOUS INFO
-------------
For Gallery 3.0.1-3.0.6, we used the ExtJS 3.3.1 zip previously available at:
  http://www.sencha.com/products/js/download.php (no longer here)

The refresh_modified.sh script should run on 3.4.0 equally as well as 3.3.1.
