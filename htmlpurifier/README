DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure git export of what's in the HTMLPurifer Standalone release
  http://htmlpurifier.org/releases/htmlpurifier-4.5.0-standalone.tar.gz

  In 3.0.x, we used HTMLPurifier Lite v4.2.0 in the contrib purifier module.

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  whats needed in gallery3/modules/gallery/vendor/HTMLPurifier


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh    # Pay attention to the HTMLPurifier version number.
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to v<VERSION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

$ git commit -m "Updated modified to r<VERSION_NUMBER>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3/modules/gallery/vendor/HTMLPurifier -p3

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ php index.php   # run tests
$ git commit -m "Updated HTMLPurifier to v<VERSION_NUMBER>"

$ cd gallery3-vendor/htmlpurifier && git push
$ cd gallery3 && git push

VERIFYING PATCHES
-----------------

We have some patches in our version of the HTMLPurifier code.

To see the differences you can run a diff command
$ diff -r modified/ ../../gallery3/modules/gallery/vendor/HTMLPurifier

Expected differences:
  - added Kohana's "no direct script access" line to each php file
  - standardize line endings
  - (manually applied) stripped the trailing ?> from Lexer/PH5P.php
